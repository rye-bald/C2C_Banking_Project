# Step 4: Create all the functions that will be needed to handle the requests (make sure you utilize header files to organize your code) and create the tables needed for accounts data
# Step 5: Create some sort of visual for the app. This can be a text-based, CLI menu, it can be a simple UI created in something like Tkinter, or it can be on a webpage using something like Flask
# Step 6: Write tests for all the functions

# Weekly milestones:
# By the end of week 2: Students have created SQL tables needed for the app and have successfully created all (or most) functions for all tasks (check balance, deposit, withdraw, create account, delete account,) and create tables for account data.
# By the end of week 3: Students have finished creating all of the functions for the task and created a UI for all remaining tasks and have written tests for all functions
# By the end of week 4: The app should be functional and meet all requirements
# Possible extension ideas: 
# Create a function to transfer money to another account (wire transfer).
# Have a text file that logs all the transactions that are being made.
# Make a more advanced UI for the app
