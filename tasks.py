# Banking System with database (Python + SQL)
# Project description for student: In this project you will create an online banking program. Users need to have an account number and PIN to identify themselves as owners of an account. Once users get into the system they will have standard options: check balance, deposit, and withdraw. Additionally, a new user or bank administrator can also create a new account, close account, and modify an account (such as edit name, PIN, or any other personal identification required to open an account).
# Project Directions:
# Step 1: Download and install VSCode,  MySQL and then create a github repo for the project.  Be sure to commit and push your changes often throughout the project.  This will keep your code safe in case of local computer crashes!  Youâ€™ll also have a history of changes you made.
# Step 2. Get familiar with SQL. Create a database in MySQL.
# Step 3: Define data structure/table(s) for users and populate with data, at least one admin user and one customer.  
# Step 4: Create all the functions that will be needed to handle the requests (make sure you utilize header files to organize your code) and create the tables needed for accounts data
# Step 5: Create some sort of visual for the app. This can be a text-based, CLI menu, it can be a simple UI created in something like Tkinter, or it can be on a webpage using something like Flask
# Step 6: Write tests for all the functions
# Weekly Lesson Topics
# Week 1 - Setup for VS Code and MySQL. Quick discussion of databases
# Week 2 - SQL queries, using databases, Python-MySQL Connector
# Week 3 - Work session for functions and UI
# Week 4 - Sharing projects for feedback
# Weekly milestones:
# By the end of week 1: Students have successfully created a github project, got their coding environment set up (VSCode + MySQL) and created a basic welcome message and menu for their app.
# By the end of week 2: Students have created SQL tables needed for the app and have successfully created all (or most) functions for all tasks (check balance, deposit, withdraw, create account, delete account, modify account) and create tables for account data.
# By the end of week 3: Students have finished creating all of the functions for the task and created a UI for all remaining tasks and have written tests for all functions
# By the end of week 4: The app should be functional and meet all requirements
# Possible extension ideas: 
# Create a function to transfer money to another account (wire transfer).
# Have a text file that logs all the transactions that are being made.
# Make a more advanced UI for the app
